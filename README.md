# RoutineHub Reports for @blue

It occured to me that I could have been using the linked folder feature now found in [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) to maintain published, git-tracked, versioned documentation of general analytics-esque data from [my RoutineHub Library](https://routinehub.co/user/blue) this whole time.

This repository is the manifestation of that idea, all enabled by [Martin de Boer's absolutely incredible **Routinehub Report shortcut**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2449/).

- Reports can be found in [**/Reports**](https://github.com/extratone/RoutinehubReport/Reports), completely unmodified. #3
- The [publicly-signed, installable .shortcut file](https://github.com/extratone/RoutinehubReport/raw/main/RoutineHubReport.shortcut) on this repo should be updated/maintained at a reasonably prompt speed. #4
- Source files documenting the Routinehub Report shortcut can be explored in [/source](https://github.com/extratone/RoutinehubReport/Reports). #4
